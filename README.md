# Optimal router allocation

This repo contains the development of the final assignment from the Operations Research course at UFMG (ministred by Prof. Eduardo Carrano). 

#### Abstract

This work proposes a solution to the WiFi router allocation problem, optimizing the installation cost. The problem is modeled to minimize the cost with routers, respecting the constraint of a minimum signal power value
at all receiving points. The formulation was tested for some created instances and the result
was satisfactory, both in qualitative terms and in computational feasibility for instances with a higher number of
variables.
